If $ \\displaystyle \\frac{d^2ELO}{dt^2} $ is negative, the player's ELO rating is increasing at a decreasing rate (or more slowly over time). We could also calculate a magnitude of this second derivative function to see how quickly a rating is speeding up or slowing down, compared to others.\n",

    "In the case of Hans Niemann, calculating the rate of change of his ELO ratings over time would give us a quantitative measure of the speed of his progression compared to other players.
