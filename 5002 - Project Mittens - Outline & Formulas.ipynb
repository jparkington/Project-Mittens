    "  - $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the ratings of player 1 and player 2, respectively.\n",

    "In this formula, the base-10 logarithm represents the odds of one player winning, given the difference in their ratings. The expected result $E$ is then used to calculate the change in ratings $ΔR$ using that same logistic function.\n",

    "So, the ELO rating system can be understood as a logistic function that maps the probability of winning a game to the relative ratings of the players, and that adjusts the ratings of the players accordingly, based on both the actual results of the game and the difference in their ratings. \n",

    "**Rate of Change**\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to represent the speed of a player like Neimann's progression in mathematical terms is by calculating the rate of change of their ELO rating over time. This can be done by fitting a mathematical function to the player's ELO ratings and finding its **derivative**, which represents the **rate of change** of the function at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ELO(t)$ be the ELO rating of a player at time $t$. The rate of change of the player's ELO rating with respect to time $t$ can be represented as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\frac{dELO}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}ELO(t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "This would offer a measure of how quickly the player's ELO rating was changing at that point in time, which can be used to compare the player's progress to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Magnitude**\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of the rate of change can be calculated as the absolute value of that same function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\displaystyle |\\frac{dELO}{dt}| $\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the absolute rate at which the player's ELO rating is changing. If the player's ELO rating is increasing rapidly, $|\\frac{dELO}{dt}|$ will be large. If the player's ELO rating is changing slowly, it will be small.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Acceleraation**\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure acceleration, we can take the derivative of the rate of change:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\displaystyle \\frac{d^2ELO}{dt^2} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{dELO}{dt}\\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula represents the **second derivative** of the function $ELO(t)$ with respect to time $t$.  If d^2ELO/dt^2 is positive, the player's ELO rating is increasing at an increasing rate. If $ \\displaystyle \\frac{d^2ELO}{dt^2} $ is negative, the player's ELO rating is increasing at a decreasing rate (or more slowly over time). We could also calculate a magnitude of this second derivative function to see how quickly a rating is speeding up or slowing down, compared to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Hans Niemann, calculating the rate of change of his ELO ratings over time would give us a quantitative measure of the speed of his progression compared to other players. This could provide a useful mathematical representation of the remarkable nature of his rise to Grandmaster status at such a young age."
